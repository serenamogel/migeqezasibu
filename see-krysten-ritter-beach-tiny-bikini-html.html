The pictures capture special moments in their friendship, including trips to the beach and other random outings. The&nbsp;<a href=#>Jessica Jones&nbsp;</a>star looks amazing in every <a href=#>outfit</a> pictured, with the bikini photos showing off her toned physique.</p><p>But most importantly, Krysten Ritter looks like she’s having a really good time with her friend. “Happy birthday, Ang!” the 41-year-old wrote in the caption. “You are a queen and thank heavens for you. I’m booking the next adventure immediately.” Some fans took to the comments to share well wishes too. Others just posted heart and fire emojis in response to the bikini photos.</p><p>Krysten Ritter’s acting career has been rather quiet lately. Her last film project was the 2021 dark fantasy film,&nbsp;Nightbooks. Directed by David Yarovesky from a script by Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis, the movie is based on the 2018 children’s book of the same name by J. A. White. The story follows Alex who is obsessed with scary stories.</p><p>But his love of spooky stuff takes an ugly turn when Alex is imprisoned by an evil young witch in her contemporary New York City apartment. The <a data-wpil=url href=#>Netflix</a> film stars Winslow Fegley as Alex alongside Lidya Jewett as Yasmin, a girl who was trapped by the witch years ago. Krysten Ritter stars as Natacha, the witch who kidnaps the children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/krysten-ritter-jessica-jones-scaled-e1652105471463-900x506.jpg><p>For her latest television project, Krysten Ritter will appear in&nbsp;Love and Death.
