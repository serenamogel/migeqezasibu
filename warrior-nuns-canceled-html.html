Fans of the Netflix fantasy <a href=#>drama</a>&nbsp;Warrior Nun&nbsp;will be left disheartened, on account of the fact that there apparently aren’t enough fans of the Netflix fantasy drama. Despite having an unprecedentedly-high&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">audience approval rating</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline&nbsp;</a>reports that just one month after&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 2</a> of&nbsp;Warrior Nun&nbsp;was released, the streaming giant decided to pull the plug on the show.</p><p>The series, based on the Ben Dunn comic book series&nbsp;Warrior Nun Areala, follows a teenage girl who wakes up in a morgue and discovers that she’s been inducted into an ancient order tasked with fighting demons. While it never became particularly popular, it still has a dedicated fanbase. Fans launched a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter campaign</a>&nbsp;shortly after Season 2’s release in hopes of getting Netflix to commit to a third season, but to no avail.</p><p>Despite fans’ attempts, Season 2 of&nbsp;&nbsp;Warrior Nun&nbsp;only spent three weeks in English Language Netflix’s weekly top 10 ratings, never going higher than #5 on the list. It was a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bit of a surprise</a>&nbsp;that the series got renewed for a second season, to begin with, and Season 2 was apparently released without any promotional budget whatsoever. So, while fans are no doubt disappointed, the series’ cancellation is not a major surprise.</p><p>Netflix is, of course, well-known for greenlighting tons of unknown series and canceling them if they don’t perform well.&nbsp;Warrior Nun&nbsp;is just the latest in a long line of mothballed shows. In the past few months, Netflix has announced the cancellation of&nbsp;The Midnight Club,&nbsp;The Bastard Son & The Devil Himself,&nbsp;Partner Track,&nbsp;The Imperfects,&nbsp;Fate: The Winx Saga, and&nbsp;First Kill.</p><p>Mass cancellations, such as the one surrounding&nbsp;Warrior Nun’s&nbsp;demise, are nothing new for Netflix. However, this news comes at a time when the streaming giant faces untold competition and unprecedented hardship. With the company losing stock value, laying off employees, and losing the top spot to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Prime Video</a>, the future of the company doesn’t seem nearly as surefire as it did at the end of 2021 when the COVID-19 pandemic drove hundreds of millions of pairs of eyes to the platform.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/warriornunmain-900x473.jpg><p>However, for every canceled series like&nbsp;Warrior Nun, Netflix tends to have another up its sleeve. True to form, Netflix has several new series in the pipeline, including an animated adaptation of&nbsp;Tomb Raider, an animated series based on&nbsp;Magic: The Gathering, a live-action adaptation of&nbsp;<a href=#>My Hero Academia</a>, a crime drama about the opioid crisis called&nbsp;Painkiller, a crime drama called&nbsp;Jigsaw, a drama series called&nbsp;The Lying Life of Adults, and much more.&nbsp;</p><p>Only time will tell whether Netflix’s rapid-fire approach to series creation will serve it well in the end. Having a huge back catalog of original content such as&nbsp;Warrior Nun&nbsp;can be seen as an asset for the streaming service — but only if subscribers want to go back and watch the shows after they’ve been canceled. A series that ends too early is less likely to get a re-watch than a series that’s allowed to play out until a natural ending, so Netflix’s approach might end up backfiring in the long run.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ivkae%2FqrvRZqWupqNisKK6wp6jnpxencGuuA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
