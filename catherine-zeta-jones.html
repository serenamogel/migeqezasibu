However, she became more selective about her film work, as she and Douglas began spending more of their time living in Bermuda, far away from the Hollywood spotlight. Zeta-Jones surfaced as a lead in the romantic comedy No Reservations (2007), and then again in the little-seen films Death Defying Acts (2007) and The Rebound (2009).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the meantime, the actress showed off her versatility with her Broadway debut in the 2009 revival of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/stephen-sondheim data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stephen Sondheim" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Stephen Sondheim</a> musical A Little Night Music, with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/angela-lansbury data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Angela Lansbury" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Angela Lansbury</a>.

According to several reports, soon after they were introduced, he told her, "I want to father your children." The pair soon became a couple, despite a 25-year age difference. They welcomed their first child together, son Dylan, in August 2000, and later that year they married at New York City's posh Plaza Hotel. In 2003, she and Douglas added to their family with the arrival of daughter Carys.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2010, Zeta-Jones put work aside to support her husband through a difficult time: He successfully battled throat cancer, but the family crisis put a strain on them all. The following year, Zeta-Jones sought treatment for bipolar II, a type of manic depression, also publicly acknowledging that she had been diagnosed with the mental health disorder. At the time, she told InStyle magazine, "I'm not the kind of person who likes to shout out my personal issues from the rooftops but, with my bipolar becoming public, I hope fellow sufferers will know it is completely controllable." In April 2013, Zeta-Jones again checked into a treatment center for help with her illness.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That August, it was revealed that she and her husband were going through a difficult time. The pair decided to take "some time apart to evaluate and work on their marriage," according to a statement given to The Huffington Post by their spokesperson. It was reported later that year that they had reconciled.</p><ul data-node-id=20 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Catherine Zeta-Jones</li><li>Birth Year: 1969</li><li>Birth date: September 25, 1969</li><li>Birth City: Swansea</li><li>Birth Country: Wales</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Catherine Zeta-Jones is an Academy Award-winning Welsh actress known for such films as 'Traffic' and 'Chicago.'
