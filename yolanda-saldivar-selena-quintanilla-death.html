But after <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musician/selena data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Selena Quintanilla" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Selena Quintanilla</a>’s dad, Abraham Quintanilla, found hints that Saldívar was embezzling money from the singer’s boutiques, the father-manager demanded she prove her innocence. The prospect of losing everything she loved inadvertently drove Saldívar to kill the singer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Yolanda wanted to kill Selena because Selena was firing Yolanda. She wouldn’t exist if she didn’t have Selena. And if she didn’t work for Selena, she didn’t want to work for anybody,” Carlos Valdez, a district judge in Nueces County, Texas who served as the lead prosecutor in Saldívar subsequent murder trial, later told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.aetv.com/real-crime/selenas-death-yolanda-saldivar data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="A&E Real Crime" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">A&E Real Crime</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Saldívar started a fan club for the singer and managed her boutiques</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Saldívar’s relationship with the Quintanillas started in 1991 — the same year the then-30-year-old received her license as a registered nurse — when she contacted Abraham to talk about starting a fan club for the Tejano singer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Saldívar had attended one of Selena’s concerts and wanted to start a club in San Antonio, which later grew to over 1,500 members in the four years she was involved. As the fan club thrived under Saldívar’s leadership, the Quintanillas began to entrust her with more and more responsibilities.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Saldívar was eventually promoted to manage Selena’s new boutiques for her clothing line and even <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/04/02/friends-warned-selena-about-possessive-aide/20d88f6d-18f1-4c60-a6c8-e8b18c4c1bef/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="controlled the singer’s business checking accounts" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">controlled the singer’s business checking accounts</a>. Saldívar also had a key to the home Selena shared with her husband, guitarist Chris Pérez.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The registered nurse quickly became intrinsically involved in Selena’s life, though others around her saw several red flags about her obsessive behavior.</p><img alt="Selena Quintanilla" title="Selena Quintanilla" width=1612 height=2316 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-50437725.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Arlene Richie/Media Sources/Media Sources/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images/Getty Images</span><p>Selena Quintanilla performing in 1995</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Her devotion to Selena turned into a possessive attachment</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By several accounts, it seems Saldívar started becoming dangerously obsessed with the singer she admired. According to an article published in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/the-queen-is-dead/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Texas Monthly" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Texas Monthly</a> shortly after Selena’s death, Saldívar’s apartment was “like a shrine” for the singer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Martin Gomez, one of the designers who shared office space with Saldívar, was also alarmed with her attachment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"She was very vindictive. She was very possessive of Selena," Gomez, then 30, told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/04/02/friends-warned-selena-about-possessive-aide/20d88f6d-18f1-4c60-a6c8-e8b18c4c1bef/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Washington Post" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Washington Post</a> days after Selena’s death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"She'd get, like, very angry if you crossed her. She would play so many mind games, say people had said things they hadn't said,” he <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/04/02/friends-warned-selena-about-possessive-aide/20d88f6d-18f1-4c60-a6c8-e8b18c4c1bef/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=explained class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">explained</a>. “So many things would happen to the clothing I was working on. I knew that I had finished a certain piece, but I would come back from a trip to New York and the hems would be ripped out. It was very strange."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gomez eventually quit his job after several strange run-ins with Saldívar, six weeks before she killed Selena. He left with a final warning to the singer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"The last call I had with Selena, the last call, I told her to be careful," Gomez recalled saying. "It was very weird. I was very afraid of Yolanda. But I never thought she would hurt Selena. I never thought it would come to this."</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">A confrontation between the pair preceded Selena's murder</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After people started reaching out to Abraham about missed payments and receiving nothing from the fan club after paying dues, he began to investigate Saldívar and became convinced she was embezzling money.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On March 9, 1995, Abraham, Selena and her sister Suzette confronted Saldívar and accused her of stealing money from the boutiques and the fan club. Abraham fired Saldívar on the spot, though Selena reportedly kept in contact with her as she needed several financial documents Saldívar had.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Saldívar stalled for weeks before telling Selena to meet her at a motel on March 31 so she could provide the records. After briefly stalling again by telling Selena she had been <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.aetv.com/real-crime/selenas-death-yolanda-saldivar data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="sexually assaulted in Mexico" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">sexually assaulted in Mexico</a>, which resulted in a trip to the hospital, the two women returned to the Days Inn in Corpus Christi, Texas, where Selena once again demanded the documents.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Saldívar finally turned them over, but as Selena left the room, Saldívar pulled out the gun she had bought days earlier and shot Selena under her right shoulder. Doctors would later discover the bullet severed the young singer’s artery.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Eyewitnesses at the scene later recalled the scary encounter — and it didn’t seem like an accident.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“The fact that Yolanda Saldívar came out of the room immediately after the shooting with a gun in her hand, pointed it at Selena…and then calling her a b***h‘ as [Selena] was running away: all that indicates an intentional act,” Valdez told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.aetv.com/real-crime/selenas-death-yolanda-saldivar data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="A&E Real Crime" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">A&E Real Crime</a>. “If it had been an accident, the reaction would’ve been completely different.”</p><img alt="Selena Quintanilla death" title="Selena Quintanilla death" width=3072 height=2048 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-50604069.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Barbara Laing/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images/Getty Images</span><p>A crowd of fans paying tribute to Selena outside her family home shortly after her death</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Selena was able to identify Saldívar as her shooter before dying</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While heavily bleeding, Selena was able to run to the lobby and<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.aetv.com/real-crime/selenas-death-yolanda-saldivar data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" identify Saldívar as her shooter" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> identify Saldívar as her shooter</a> before collapsing. The Grammy-winner was rushed to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead due to blood loss and cardiac arrest while undergoing emergency surgery.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While Selena died at the hospital, Saldívar stayed on the scene of the crime for hours in a standoff with police. The nurse had locked herself in her car, threatening to kill herself with the same gun.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I was on the phone with her for seven and a half hours,” Larry Rucker Young, lead negotiator with the Corpus Christi Police Department, told A&E Real Crime. “Yolanda didn’t ask for anything. What she wanted, really, was to hear what was going on with Selena. Her condition.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“She wanted someone to hear her story,” he continued. “That they are best friends. That she loves Selena. She admires Selena. She would do anything for her.”</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Saldívar was sentenced to prison after a short jury deliberation</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Saldívar was charged with first-degree murder and was put on trial, with her main defense being that she had fired accidentally.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After a short three-hour deliberation, the jury returned a guilty verdict on October 23, 1995. Three days later, Saldívar was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in 30 years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Saldívar is currently serving her sentence at Mountain View Unit, a maximum-security women’s prison in Gatesville, Texas. She’ll be eligible for parole in 2025.</p><img alt="Selena rocking a casual look with a tied white-collared shirt and jeans" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-50438913.jpg title="Selena rocking a casual look with a tied white-collared shirt and jeans" width=1668 height=2452 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiaq6Gdmny6u8uapZ2ZXaiurbDIr5irZaOauaa6wGaorqGeqa6vtculmGaclZbBqQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
