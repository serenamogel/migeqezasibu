As per this report, it’s become clear that the show was faced with numerous overhauls of its creative direction throughout development and pre-production, with three different head honchos in charge across the process.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/olivia-colman-secret-invasion-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/everet-ross-secret-invasion-1-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/secret-invasion-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/secret-invasion-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/secret-invasion-nick-fury-maria-hill-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gravik-secret-invasion-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Secret-Invasion-Nicky-Fury-and-Talos-1-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/emilia-clarke-secret-invasion-giah-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/skrull-secret-invasion-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/secret-invasion.jpg><p data-characters=567 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>First of all, Mr. Robot graduate Kyle Bradstreet seemed like a safe pair of hands to entrust Secret Invasion in, but after a year working on scripts he was fired and replaced by new showrunner Brian Tucker (Broken City), with directors Ali Selim and Thomas Bezucha (Let it Go) also involved in breaking the story. Having three cooks in the kitchen turned out to be a bad move, however, as the various creative leaders are said to have “vied for supremacy.” According to one insider, “It was weeks of people not getting along, and it erupted.”</p><p data-characters=574 data-current-count=574 data-injectable=true>Marvel then sent senior exec Jonathan Schwartz, a member of the studio’s creative committee The Parliament (which could not sound more like a supervillain group name, but OK), to get production back on schedule amid considerable delays that was leaving the show at risk of losing its cast due to scheduling conflicts. Bezucha, due to helm three episodes, ultimately exited, leaving Selim to direct the full series himself. Likewise, exec Chris Gary, who was tasked with overseeing the series, is reportedly due to move on when his contract expires at the end of 2023.</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=248 data-injectable=false>While Secret Invasion is an extreme example, it’s clear that creative clashes are par for the course for Marvel’s TV shows. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">As one insider summarized it to THR</a>: “TV is a writer-driven medium.
