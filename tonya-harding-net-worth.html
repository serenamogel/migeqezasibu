Furthermore, Harding is known in sports history as the second woman who was able to complete a triple axel during competition, and so is considered to be one of the more impressive skaters.</p><p>So just how rich is Tonya Harding, as of mid-2017? Authoritative sources estimate that Tonya who has been able to accumulate an estimated net worth $10,000, diminished largely by a reputation she acquired as a result of an incident with rival <a href=#>Nancy Kerrigan</a> in 1994, which has subsequently limited her earning capacity.</p><h3>&nbsp;Tonya Harding Net Worth $10,000</h3><p>Tonya Maxine Harding’s mother was LaVona Fay Golden, while her father was already the fifth husband of LaVona. Tonya was raised together with Chris Davison, her half-brother, but he died after an accident on the road. This is the one reason why Tonya’s childhood wasn’t really happy, but there is another one – father Al Harding had some serious problems with his health and couldn’t work all the time as a healthy man, that’s why the family sometimes had big problems with money, and possibly why her mother abused her daughter physically. Despite these circumstances Tonya Harding was able to succeed to an extent.</p><p>Tonya started to practice figure skating at three years old and at the age of 12 was already considered to be a successful athlete. She placed well in US Championships from the mid-’80s, but didn’t win a title until 1991, after completing the famed triple axel, and then finished in silver place in the World Championship. In Skate America that year, she had three ‘firsts’ – a short program triple axel, two triples in one competition, and a triple axel plus double toe loop. All looked well for the 1992 Winter Olympics, but she finished fourth.</p><p>However, Tonya is well-known not only thanks to her talents as a skater, but also because of the scandal around the personality of <a href=#>Nancy Kerrigan</a>. <a href=#>Nancy</a> was attacked by an unknown man in 1994, when she was skating a practice session prior to participating in the US Figure Skating Championship. When investigations began, some interesting details showed up: for example, the man who attacked <a href=#>Nancy Kerrigan</a> was hired by the husband of Tonya Harding and his close friend. This became a huge scandal, however, Tonya’s net worth rose even more due to increased attention to her personality. She was selected for the Olympics, but finished eighth to Kerrigan’s second, and when investigations into the attack were completed, Harding was banned for life from competitive figure skating.</p><p>Since then Harding has been briefly involved in boxing, music and acting, plus selling a celebrity sex tape in conjunction with her first husband to Penthouse magazine for a reputed $200,000. Her notoriety from that one incident now more than 20 years ago apparently continues to dog her life, and stymie efforts to increase her net worth.</p><p>Talking about her personal life, Tonya Harding married her first husband at 19 years old in 1990, however, the couple divorced four years later. Her second husband was Michael Smith, but this relationship lasted less than a year in the mid-90s. Tonya’s third husband&nbsp; is Joseph Jens Price – they married in 2010, and their son was born a year later.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=21.517412935323><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Tonya Harding</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 12, 1970</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Portland, Oregon, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft (1.54 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>136 lbs (61.69 kg)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Former figure skater, two-time Olympian, two-time Skate America Champion</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>David Douglas High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Spouse</td><td>Joseph Jens Price (m. 2010), Michael Smith (m. 1995–1996), Jeff Gillooly (m. 1990–1993)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Gordon Price (b. 2011)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Al Harding, LaVona Fay Golden</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Chris Davison (died)</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Tonya Maxine Harding</td></tr><tr readability=0.3265306122449><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/TheTonyaHarding/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.28><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/thetonyaharding?lang=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002125</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.27586206896552><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/tonya-harding-mn0001011878</a></td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Awards</td><td>Skate America 1989, Winter Olympics, World Championships (1990/1991, 2nd place), Nations Cup (1989/1990, 1st place), U.S. Olympic Festival (1990/1991, 2nd place)</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Golden Blades</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Movies</td><td>Nancy & Tonya (2014, documentary), The Price of Gold (2014), The Prize Fighter (2003), Figure Skating Superstars: Brian Boitano and Friends (1995), Breakaway</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>TV Shows</td><td>The Early Show, The Smoking Gun Presents: World's Dumbest....
