Her Instagram, in particular, reveals a lot about the star’s private life. Mei has a highlighted stories folder on Instagram called M&M, which contains many photos.</p><p>There are numerous pictures of them hanging out together in the aforementioned highlight folder, including one on a rollercoaster.</p><p>The picture, which was posted on August 30, 2019, revealed that they had been together for more than 5 years at the time — there was text on one end of a doodled pointer that read, “5.5 years with this guy,” while the other end pointed to Matt.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=quick-facts></span>Quick Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table id=factsDetail class=highlight style=width:97.3675%;height:253px><tbody><tr style=height:23px><td style=width:47.9401%;height:23px><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td style=width:208.24%;height:23px>Matt Stonie</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=width:47.9401%;height:23px><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td style=width:208.24%;height:23px>24th May 1992</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=width:47.9401%;height:23px><strong>Age</strong></td><td style=width:208.24%;height:23px>31 years</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=width:47.9401%;height:23px><strong>Height/How tall?<br></strong></td><td style=width:208.24%;height:23px>5 feet and 8 inches</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=width:47.9401%;height:23px><strong>Profession</strong></td><td style=width:208.24%;height:23px>Major League Eating</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=width:47.9401%;height:23px><strong>Father Name</strong></td><td style=width:208.24%;height:23px>Dorian Stonie</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=width:47.9401%;height:23px><strong>Mother Name</strong></td><td style=width:208.24%;height:23px>Cathy Stonie</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=width:47.9401%;height:23px><strong>Gender Identity</strong></td><td style=width:208.24%;height:23px>Male</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=width:47.9401%;height:23px><strong>Is Married?</strong></td><td style=width:208.24%;height:23px>No</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=width:47.9401%;height:23px><strong>Is Gay?<br></strong></td><td style=width:208.24%;height:23px>No</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=width:47.9401%;height:23px><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td style=width:208.24%;height:23px>$700 thousand</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=matt-stonie-net-worth></span>Matt Stonie Net worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Matt Stonie’s net worth is about $700 thousand as of June 2023.</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-truth-has-been-disclosed></span>The Truth Has Been Disclosed<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Matt Stonie, like many public figures, had kept his personal and professional lives separate. The internet celebrity had never mentioned anything about relationships or marriage and had always avoided questions about it. However, Mei’s Instagram handle revealed the secret, despite the fact that the YouTuber has not officially announced his relationship status.</p><p>Mei took to Instagram on Valentine’s Day 2019 to officially reveal that they had their first conversation 5 years and 2 days ago. That means they’ve known each other for more than 7 years as of May 2021.<br>Similarly, when she shared a photo of the competitive eater on her Instagram accounts, one of her friends commented, “still cool to know your bf is Matt Stonie lol.”<br>“Yeah, small world,” she replied, confirming her relationship.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=matt-would-rather-keep-secrets-than-reveal-them></span>Matt would rather keep secrets than reveal them<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Another post on Mei’s Instagram, dated April 26, 2017, features a photo of them with the caption “3.5 years strong #happyanniversary.” Similarly, Mei was seen celebrating Christmas with Matt’s family in another post from her account. “Christmas with the Stonies,” the post’s caption read.</p><p>This suggests that Matt’s parents have been aware of their relationship for some time, as both parties appear to be at ease with each other. Having said that, the YouTuber has not revealed anything about his long-term relationship, implying that he prefers to keep his personal life private.</p><p>In his most recent YouTube video, we can hear a girl talking in the background, which is ironic. Mei, who has pictures of Matt Behind the Scenes with his crew on his Instagram, is most likely the one who handles the camera for Matt’s YouTube videos.</p><p>Despite the fact that their relationship has been kept hidden for so long, it appears to have a future. Mei, the YouTuber’s current girlfriend, refers to them as a family of four, which includes their two dogs, Gray and Goma.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWRqcFuv9OopaKdXZa7pXnGoqmlnqKesq%2BwjKacoqtdp7KtrdOipqermJ69brDErZiipKNitaLCxGaZnp2eYr%2BmwsSao56cXam1psXVnmSbnZWjeqWt06KloGWWpL9uu9WeqWarlauyr3nYnpirq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
