So you can make the right choice on your next Civilization V playthrough.</p><p>My picks are organized by victory type and civilization, so this should be easy to skim as well.</p><h2>Best Leaders for Science Victory (Civ V)</h2><p>Science victories have always been the most fun, because they allow you to research crazy technologies many ages after they existed in the real world.</p><p>There’s nothing more hilarious than seeing canons in the second century, at least in my opinion!</p><p>Here are my picks for the best leaders for a Science victory, if that’s your kinda thing.</p><h3>Babylon – Nebuchadnezzar II</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/9909/09-babylon-nebuchadnezzar-ii-civ5-leader.jpg><p>Although not as well-rounded as Korea, Babylon has a bunch of small improvements that will help you go for a science victory, and advance in technological discoveries much quicker than other civs.</p><p>With Babylon, you can build an academy very early on.</p><p>This makes it one of the best civilizations in general (well, for a science victory). They lack a strong military, though. So fair warning.</p><h3>Korea – Sejong</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/9909/08-korea-sejong-civilization-5-leader.jpg><p>Korea is arguably the best civilization in the game if you’re looking to get a science victory.</p><p>They have a special ability where all Great Person improvements, as well as all specialists, get a +2 bonus to science.</p><p>This will allow you to turn a ton of your tiles into science-oriented ones.</p><p>You should also look to build science-oriented wonders above anything else, too. You can use the improvements on them to boost the science yield even further!</p><h2>Best Leaders for Culture Victory (Civ V)</h2><p>Whether you’d like to sell your soul to the devil and become like Dubai, or follow a more traditional cultural path a la Europe, you’ll want to pick one of these leaders (and/or civs) to start your new game on the cultural side.</p><h3>Brazil – Pedro II</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/9909/07-brazil-pedro-ii-civilization-v-leader.jpg><p>Brazil will see you getting more tourists than any other.</p><p>Mostly thanks to their bonus for doubling all tourists in the region, as well as the unique ability to summon extra Great Persons when a <a href=#>Golden Age arises</a>.</p><p>If you want an easy win and you’re going for a cultural victory, you’ll want to give the Brazilians a try. They will not disappoint.</p><p>Besides, they do have some rather strong units that will help you defend your territory against any incoming foes, should the chance for war draw close to your touristic borders.</p><h3>Egypt – Ramesses II</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/9909/06-egypt-ramesses-ii-civ-v-leader.jpg><p>Even though Egypt is seen as a powerful militaristic civilization in the game, it allows for various playthroughs that make it a well-rounded civ as a whole.</p><p>Egypt’s ability to create wonders faster than anyone else is probably the main reason why so many people love them. And that’s exactly why I think they’re the best for a cultural victory.</p><p>Spam those wonders and win, my son.</p><h2>Best Leaders for Diplomacy Victory (Civ V)</h2><p>Honestly, I never found it entertaining to play for a Diplomacy victory.</p><p>Why play peacefully when you can nuke the living crap out of your enemies? Virtually, of course.</p><p>In any case, these are my favorite leaders for a Diplomacy victory.</p><h3>Venice – Enrico Dandolo</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/9909/05-venice-enrico-dandolo-civ-v-leader.jpg><p>Added in the <a href=#>Brave New World update</a>, the Venetian civilization is one of the best for a diplomacy victory, thanks to its unique gameplay strategies.</p><p>These are far too complex to go into details, but the way the Venetians build up their diplomacy is, alone, a <strong>fantastic reason</strong> to give them a go when opting for this path.</p><p>If you’re interested to learn more there’s actually <a href=#>this guide</a>, well worth a read.</p><h3>Siam – Ramkhamhaeng</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/9909/04-siam-ramkhamhaeng-civilization-5-leader.jpg><p>I always found it great to play with city-states as your allies.</p><p>And I have to say that there’s no better way to do it than with the Siam.</p><p>You’ll be able to increase your Food, Culture, and Faith by becoming friendlier with city-states, which can be done easily thanks to the diplomatic bonuses of the civilization.</p><p>City-states will also help you build up a strong military so you can focus on your diplomacy all you want, without forgetting about your armies.</p><h2>Best Leaders for Domination Victory (Civ V)</h2><p>Ah, Domination.</p><p>Destroy cities, conquer your enemies, and annoy Gandhi to the point where he’ll decide to nuke you and start the most dangerous war in the history of Earth.</p><p>But which Civ 5 leaders are best fit for the role?</p><h3>Poland – Casimir III</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/9909/03-poland-casimir-iii-civ5-leader.jpg><p>If you love cavalry, you’ll want to use Poland.</p><p>Not only do they have unique Winged Hussars, but also a unique type of stable that’s <strong>way superior</strong> to the average one in the game.</p><p>Poland is not only one for the best civilizations for a domination victory, but it also stands as the best rounded-up civilization in the game.</p><p>You can actually pick Poland and go for any type of victory. That’s how awesome they are.</p><h3>Zulu – Shaka</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/9909/02-zulu-shaka-civilization-5-leader.jpg><p>The Zulu have a unique unit that makes it one of the coolest civs out there, as well as a powerful military bonus that will have you looking for a domination victory as soon as the game starts.</p><p>You’ll be able to make it pretty far into a Civ 5 campaign if you opt for an early rush strategy. But the mid-game is where the Zulu becomes the most powerful here.</p><h3>Hunnic – Attila</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/9909/01-hunnic-attila-civilization-5-leader.jpg><p>Atilla and the Huns are the most offensive civilization in the game, run by one hell of a leader.</p><p>They have siege units available earlier than any other civ, while also having Attila as their Leader, who’s the best conqueror the world has ever seen.</p><p>As a Hun, you’ll want to rush your enemies in the early game and take full advantage of your early-game siege and powerful infantry.</p><p>Wipe the floors and conquer the world before the game is even halfway done.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p63Nnaamq6CkwW%2BvzqZmnKGmanqjsdKtZJyhpqh6rbHAnZyrq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
