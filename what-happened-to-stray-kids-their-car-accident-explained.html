Initially, Megan Thee Stallion was also scheduled to perform but eventually canceled. Unfortunately, however, StrayKids fans will not be able <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to catch all eight members performing on stage</a>, as some of them are currently on a temporary break.

According <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to the announcement made by JYP Entertainment</a> – the group’s label – the three members were inside the car when the accident occurred, and will be taking some time off to rest and recover.</p><p>“While returning to their dorms after a schedule on September 20th (Wednesday), the vehicle carrying Stray Kids members Lee Know, Hyunjin, and Seungmin was involved in a minor collision. After the minor collision, Lee Know, Hyunjin, and Seungmin immediately visited a hospital and received a thorough medical examination.
