Put it on a salad, slather it on pizza, or use it as a dip for fries. Honestly, including ranch on this list was a no-brainer because it goes with everything, sweet potato fries included. And topping Sporked‘s list of the <a href=#>best ranch dressings</a>? Marie’s Creamy Ranch, which is thick enough to cling to fries without a glob landing in your lap but creamy enough to help your fries melt in your mouth. Skip any additional seasoning on your sweet potato fries so this ranch can fully shine!</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>Best Ranch Dressings to Buy For Pizza, Wings, Salad: Oh My!</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hidden Valley Southwest Chipotle Ranch</a></strong><p>If regular ranch is too basic, step up the spice with Hidden Valley Southwest Chipotle Ranch. Sporked senior writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Myrick</a> suggested this be renamed “taco ranch,” because it tastes a lot like regular ranch mixed with taco seasoning, with just a hint of that chipotle smokiness. A lot of restaurants serve their sweet potato fries with a smoky dipping sauce. Look! You’re basically a restaurant chef now!</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>Every Hidden Valley Ranch Product, Ranked</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tabitha Brown for Target Vegan Lemon Dill Garlic Spread</a></strong><p>After tasting the Tabitha Brown for Target Vegan Lemon Dill Garlic Spread, Jordan was looking for more ways to incorporate it into their cooking. Might I suggest using it as a dipping sauce for sweet potato fries? This vegan spread is herbaceous and a little tart, like a good aioli (minus the egg yolks). The only thing this sauce doesn’t have in its symphony of flavors is sweetness, so the fries really complete the picture.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>We Tried Every Spread from the Tabitha Brown for Target Collection, Because That’s Our Business</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kewpie Mayonnaise</a></strong><p>Sure, you could use any ol’ mayo as a dipping sauce for sweet potato fries and, you know what? It’s going to be great. Creamy, salty mayo on a deep-fried spear of sweet potato? You truly can’t go wrong. But if you really want to wow, you should pick up a bottle of Kewpie. As Sporked contributor <a href=#>Danny Palumbo wrote</a> in his ranking of the best mayos, “While the most prominent flavor here is egg, there’s also a lot of additional savoriness, probably from the added MSG. As far as I know, it’s the only mayonnaise to add MSG.” MSG has gotten a bad reputation, but we are big defenders here at Sporked. The umami savoriness of MSG works perfectly with the sweetness of sweet potato fries.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>Best Mayonnaise: Call Us the Mayo Clinic Because We Ranked the 8 Best Mayos</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brooklyn Delhi Curry Ketchup</a></strong><p>I won’t lie to you, Heinz reigns supreme in my heart and taste buds (and <a href=#>Sporked‘s ketchup ranking</a>), but there’s a better ketchup to complement sweet potato fries. Flavored with roasted garlic, chilies, and ginger, Brooklyn Delhi Curry Ketchup is the ketchup to help maximize the flavor of fried sweet potatoes. Jordan hit the nail on the head when they praised this ketchup for adding a spiced, aromatic punch to your bites.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>Best Ketchup: 7 Best Ketchups</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFusMipp6Kml2LAosHCnmSfp6JiwLixxK1kqaeklsGwecWroJ5n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
