("The other one" rather savagely refers to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Marla Maples</a>, with whom Donald Trump had an extra-marital affair while he was married to Ivana.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for the Melania, added to The Atlantic that Melania and Ivanka have "always shared a close relationship and still do today.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last year, The New York Times reported that the First Lady and First Daughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>had a "complicated" relationship</a>, which would be understandable — after all, working with your step-mother in the White House doesn't exactly sound like a cakewalk.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to that report, then-White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, who was responsible for managing the relationship between Ivanka and Melania’s offices, had to work out a situation in which both Ivanka and Melania shared self-congratulatory social media posts of themselves each holding small black children. It's still unclear what the situation was, but either way, it was enough of a problem for Kelly to have to reportedly step in and discuss the overlap with Ivanka's staff.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To that end, though, a source "close to Ivanka" also told The Atlantic that the two share a “desire to be mutually respectful,” but added that their relationship is certainly not “affectionate.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That quote might not signal the kind of closeness that Grisham implied in her statement, but it does line up with what Ivana said: they like each other just "fine," and at the very least, aren't sworn enemies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGegmr%2B0u82ao2aqlZbAsLqMoq2appuWerW%2B1KanZp%2BVqcBurcuopaBlnZq5orrImg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
