It wouldn’t be a stretch to say that if it starred anyone other than Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead role, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it would have been quickly dismissed as Netflix’s latest inane action-packed offering</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=467 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true>However, through sheer force of will and undeniable star power alone, the inimitable icon has single-handedly turned the spy series into must-see TV, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">which was an outcome everybody could have admittedly seen coming from a mile away</a>. The CGI is unconvincing, the jokes are cringeworthy, the set pieces are perfunctory, and it’s about as derivative and uninspired as its central concept could possibly hope to be; but dammit, it’s Arnold, so it gets a pass.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FUBAR-3.jpg><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=756 data-injectable=true>That’s a feeling clearly being shared by subscribers all over the world, seeing as FUBAR has shrugged off lukewarm reviews and an underwhelming response from audiences to debut as the platform’s number one episodic effort on a global scale. Per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FlixPatrol</a>, the spiritual successor to True Lies <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in everything but quality </a>has snagged the top spot in an impressive 64 countries around the world, but the big question is how long it can stay there.</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>It’s not a spoiler to say that FUBAR ends with a blatant setup for a second season, so the pressure is on Schwarzenegger’s hefty shoulders to ensure that his name and his name alone are enough to guarantee a renewal for something that wouldn’t be faring anywhere near as well as it currently is with anybody else in front-and-center.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yvsdOfo6Kwo2K5osDErKtmr5mhsa3FjK6loqWRnLavrdOirZ5lkaOxbrzAoqWfrZyhxm6vy6KaoZ2UYryztcaipZqkXZfCrbjDqLGeq12ptaZ5kGaqqaekYraveZVtZJynpaPBs7XErGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
