It all started when a school buddy named Moose steals lunches from Punky's friends until she stands up to the offender. Unfortunately, things don't go well for Punky, who gets clobbered by Moose in the restroom. Enter Hagler, a friend of Punky's fourth-grade teacher, who tries to teach the basics of self-defense to the youngster, who turns out is anything but a physical fighter. All is not lost, however, when Punky's best friend Cherie comes up with a plan to decimate Moose once and for all.</p><p>Hagler certainly demonstrated his love for children, but against professional pugilists, he was formidable. Throughout his career, which saw him win 62 fights, including 52 by knockout, Hagler possessed a singular focus of flattening opponents on the canvas.&nbsp;"If they cut my bald head open, they will find one big boxing glove,” Hagler said, per <a href=#>ESPN</a>. "That's all I am. I live it.” His career surprisingly ended in 1988 when he lost to Sugar Ray Leonard in a highly disputed split-decision, in which pundits believed Hagler actually won. Angry over the result, <a href=#>he immediately quit boxing</a>&nbsp;and embarked on an acting career in Italy, where he starred in action flicks like "Indio" and "Virtual Weapon." He died unexpectedly at 66 from <a href=#>causes never made public</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmhia4Bxe9KtmKurXZu%2FsLmMqayno6lir7Ox1qyrnqpdrry2ecOim6esXaC7sMOMnaCenF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
