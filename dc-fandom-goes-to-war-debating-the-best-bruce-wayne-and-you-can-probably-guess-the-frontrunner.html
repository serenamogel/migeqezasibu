From dark and gritty to just plain whacky (looking at you Tim Burton) the character has had multiple interpretations, but at his core, he is always someone that lives two lives, playboy billionaire by day, gruff vigilante by night. Now, these fans are looking at who they think did the best job of playing the character of Bruce Wayne specifically.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>Playing the role of Bruce Wayne is no easy feat.
