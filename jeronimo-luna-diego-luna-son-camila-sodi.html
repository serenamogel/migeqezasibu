Well, if that’s what he desires to become then he will probably even surpass his dad’s fame. The junior Luna is undoubtedly handsome just like his Mexican father, thanks to Diego’s handsome gene that runs in the family blood.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jerónimo has already stolen fans hearts. Maybe he even stole his father’s fans while he attended the world premiere of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Rogue One </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>back in 2016 together with his family. </span><span style=font-weight:400>Jerónimo is a huge fan of Star Wars, and he was all excited that his father worked in one of its franchise.

At least that’s what her Instagram posts render. But she is cautious when it comes to sharing the children’s picture. She makes sure that their faces are hidden. Camila&nbsp;is one of those celebrity moms who know&nbsp;how to keep their children’s privacy. But even from the limited pictures of Jerónimo, we can see that this handsome dude is growing well and healthy.</span></p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>A post shared by Camila Sodi (@camilasodi_)</a> on Dec 2, 2016 at 5:14pm PST</p><p>Although&nbsp;<span style=font-weight:400>Jerónimo’s parents decided to end their relationship, they have not let their children feel the need for love.
