Stone is easily an A-list name in the industry, then, and is likely to remain a favorite of cinemagoers for a long while yet. But, just for the morbid curiosity of us poor things who aren’t acting royalty, how much is Emma Stone worth these days?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/emma-stone-poor-things.png><p data-characters=579 data-current-count=879 data-injectable=true>Calm down, I promise I won’t put you through any more belabored puns before I tell you the answer. Stone is, in fact, estimated to have a current net worth of $40 million, as per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Interestingly, the bulk of her wealth was amassed thanks to a single project, and you might be able to guess which project that is. 2016’s La La Land didn’t just win her an Oscar it also landed Stone by far her biggest payday as she brought home $26 million (before tax) for that one performance. This made her the single highest-grossing actress of that year.</p><p data-characters=577 data-current-count=577 data-injectable=true>As for what she spends her well-earned money on, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stone and her husband</a> are known to have numerous properties across the U.S. In 2019, she bought herself two homes, one in Century City, LA, for $2.3 million and another in Malibu for $3.25 million. She’s also understood to have two further residences in NYC, including a West Village condo worth $2.4 million and another in the Financial District for $3.6 million. She has made some of her investments back, however, as Stone sold her Malibu property in 2022 for a profit, receiving an above-asking price of $4.4 million.</p><p data-characters=135 data-current-count=135 data-injectable=false>The title might not accurately describe its leading star, but Emma Stone’s Poor Things releases in U.S. cinemas on Dec. 8, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZWiuqJ50q2mp52jYrumwIywpqusmGK2r3mRaWlsZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
