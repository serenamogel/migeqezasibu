But If I had to pick one thing that comes close, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s corn</a>. Yes, that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">iconic big lump with knobs</a> has the juice, and I can’t imagine a more beautiful thing on a hot summer’s eve. And while trying it with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">butter</a> changed everything for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Corn Kid</a>, we are going to change everything for you with these corn on the cob seasoning options that will cause you to pop your top (or at least your corn).</p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Everything but the Elote Seasoning Blend</strong></a><p>I mean, corn and elote seasoning go together like, well, corn and elote seasoning. This stuff was MEANT for corn. Elote is a delicious Mexican street food comprising corn on the cob covered in creamy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mayo</a> and then topped with chili powder, lime, and cheese. This elote seasoning from Trader Joe’s does its best to approximate that by consolidating the flavor of the “entire dish’s multiple components into one savory sprinkle,” according to managing editor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwynedd Stuart</a>. This would be a truly great seasoning for corn on the cob, so pick some up and try it out this summer.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best Trader Joe’s seasonings</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Tajin</strong></a><p>I mean, it’s Tajin. It is salty, sour, and spicy, and it goes well on everything from fruit to a cocktail rim. And somewhere between those two extremes lies corn, wherein a sprinkling of Tajin over a thick layer of (life changing) <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">butter</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mayo</a> would easily be in the running for best corn on the cob seasoning.</p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hidden Valley Seasoning Packet</a><p>WHAT?! <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranch</a> corn?! IS THAT EVEN LEGAL?! If you can believe it, yes it is. Now, I for one think this combo is glorious. It is basically just an unfried Cool Ranch Dorito—an S-tier seasoning for corn on the cob. This packet is so dang versatile, you need it in your life whether you end up using it on corn or not. Take that as our kernel of wisdom for you today.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">every Hidden Valley Ranch product</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>TJ’s Cheesy Seasoning Blend</strong></a><p>What’s this? More Teej? Yes indeed, my friends, TJ’s does in fact know their way around a spice blend, and this cheesy, perfect seasoning for corn on the cob is no exception. Editor-in-chief <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justine Sterling</a> noted that this seasoning “has some real nuance” and “real aged flavor.” This also has a peppery flavor that puts it over the top.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best Trader Joe’s seasonings</a></strong></p><p>Yes, they actually make Tapatío in powdered form, and yes, it is actually good. While senior writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Myrick</a> did mention that this delightful powder “could be sprinkled on pretty much anything,” they were also quick to point out that it makes a great seasoning for corn on the cob, especially as the chili component of elote. Go get some of this and make it your go-to corn on the cob seasoning (not to mention <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">corn off the cob</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">popcorn</a>).</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">every Tapatio product</a></strong></p><strong>Butter</strong><p>I heard from a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reliable source</a> that it changes everything.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best butter</a></strong></p><h2>Subscribe</h2><p>Get all the top food rankings, new product reviews, and other grocery content delivered to your inbox every other week.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>By clicking submit you agree to our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Terms of Use</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/LANDING-PAGE_COOKOUT-WEEK_HEADER-1170x658.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-s-cookout-week-at-sporked><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s Cookout Week at Sporked!</a></h2><p>To kick off summer, we’re highlighting all the best foods and drinks you should be buying for cookouts, BBQs, grilling seshes, or any other type of al fresco partying and eating you’ll be doing this season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuv8SaqqimmaO0brLOq2Scp6KjerC6jK2fnmWTpK9w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
