McMahon is now <a href=#>under federal investigation</a> for the allegations.</p><p>Sean Ross Sapp of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fightful </a>(via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fightful Select</a>) reports that even before the federal investigations came to light, longtime employees said that they expected to be charged eventually. These sources said that “if the feds raided Vince and got his phone, they’ll almost surely find something.”</p><p>Sapp also cites at least one person within the industry who claims that they know more people are involved in the situation, and they indicated that if the names are not identified, they will do it themselves.</p><p>Additionally, a longtime WWE employee said that they don’t believe Janel Grant’s lawsuit is the worst of it, as they pointed to higher settlements. Sapp confirms that other potential victims have been contacted by attorneys and media outlets to determine whether they want to take action as well.</p><h2 id=h-more-details-on-john-laurinaitis-and-vince-mcmahon>More Details On John Laurinaitis&nbsp;And Vince McMahon</h2><p>John Laurinaitis has seemingly turned on Vince McMahon, as his lawyer has said that Laurinaitis is <a href=#>a victim of the former WWE CEO</a>. Sapp cites a source who called this outcome “rats jumping off of the sinking ship.” The report notes that Laurinaitis’ attorney has reached out to others in the industry, either in an attempt to find allies, figure out who has talked, or gauge his best options moving forward.</p><p>Sapp also writes that it is believed that TKO became quite aware of the “mess on their hands” after the merger, and one source shared their belief that they would have handled it differently had they been aware that this situation was coming. However, they were said to be aware last week, when Vince McMahon was present at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><h2 id=h-wwe-talent-have-not-been-briefed-on-the-situation>WWE Talent Have Not Been Briefed On The Situation</h2><p>Additionally, Sapp writes that no talent he has spoken with have had a wide talent meeting, and no one has claimed that they have been briefed about the situation regarding Vince McMahon. Instead, reactions seem to suggest that the higher-ups want to move past Vince McMahon and put him in the rearview. Sapp also cites some talent who believe that McMahon is “delusional enough” to attempt to work his way back into some kind of role. However, it was emphasized that McMahon is done, he has no path back, and WWE is trying to disassociate.</p><p>As previously reported, Brock Lesnar’s creative has been halted, as he was implicated in the suit. He was planned for Royal Rumble, Elimination Chamber, and WrestleMania 40, but these plans have been paused. Per Sapp, there are no plans for Brock Lesnar right now, but that does not mean he will never appear in WWE again.</p><p>A spokesperson for Vince McMahon <a href=#>previously said</a> the lawsuit was replete with lies.</p><p>WrestleZone will provide more information as it becomes available.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNtaG9oZGK%2FprzOq6tmraCZrrWxjKilZqqVlrC1tc6nZK2nXaGuuL%2FUoqtmmZeWtq%2B%2F02atoqaTmnqur8yan6im</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
