According to Brooks, the scene was not going well, and Depp, who did not take kindly to being told what to do, attacked Brooks by punching him in the rib cage twice, shouting, “Who the f*** are you? You have no right to tell me what to do.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/166199392_272777474447781_8111745622117417451_n.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/165330741_504744847229866_1730441021382646193_n.jpg><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=250 data-injectable=false>Brooks claims he tried to get LAPD involved, but it did not stop Depp from attacking him.

Mr. Brooks looks forward to his day in court.”</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>In his suit, Brooks claims that Depp quit his aggressive antics only after his bodyguards got involved and removed him from the scene.
