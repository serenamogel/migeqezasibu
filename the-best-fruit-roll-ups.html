They should also be incredibly nostalgic, in my opinion. Fruit Roll-Ups, Fruit by the Foot, and other flat, chewy snacks instantly transport me back to elementary school. They weren’t just vaguely fruit-adjacent treats—they were activities. You had the ones where you could punch out different shapes and build little slices of pizza. Others were long, and you’d try to eat them as fast as you could. Even the boring natural fruit ones (the “leathers”) were fun to peel off the plastic lining at the very least.</p><p>&nbsp;We tried a bunch of different brands, types, and styles of fruit roll ups to find the best fruit roll ups you can buy. The roll ups that made the list are ones that we’d happily pack in our adult lunch boxes.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best fruit roll up" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RANKING-UPDATE_FRUIT-ROLLS_INSET-06.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Budget</p><strong>Good & Gather Organic Fruit Strip Variety Pack</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>These are the best fruit strips we tried. Not only are the taste and texture great, they have a wide variety of flavors like mango, wildberry, strawberry, and apricot (just to name a few). These are Target brand, so they’re easy to find and they’re a decent price for fruit leather made with no artificial colors or flavors. If you’re looking for fruit strips, these are the best fruit strips to buy at the grocery store.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best fruit roll ups" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RANKING-UPDATE_FRUIT-ROLLS_INSET-05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for Kids</p><strong>Trader Joe’s Peel Away Fruit Leather Buttons</strong><p>The Trader Joe’s Fruit Leather Buttons have the cutest design. The round, silver dollar-sized pieces easily peel off the paper, making for breezy enjoyment. You have two excellent flavor options with these: grape mango and strawberry mango. The texture is natural, but not too organic and fruit leather-y. I know some of the other, more sugary fruit roll ups might seem like they’d be better for kids, but these are packaged in a way that makes them great for lunchtime sharing.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best fruit roll up" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RANKING-UPDATE_FRUIT-ROLLS_INSET-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best All Natural</p><strong>Jovy Fruit Roll</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>I am lukewarm on mango in general, but the Mango Jovy Fruit Roll made me a diehard mango stan. The flavor is so natural and fresh and sweet. I would absolutely buy these again. Unfortunately, these were docked a Spork for their packaging. The little cartoon child on the wrapper completely undermines how deliciously mature these fruit roll ups are. Additionally, they’re a little sticky, which makes consumption a little more difficult. This is less of a fruit roll up and more of a fruit leather, but it’s some of the best fruit leather, so we must include it. If Jovy upgraded its presentation, these would be a perfect 10/10.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best fruit roll up" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RANKING-UPDATE_FRUIT-ROLLS_INSET-03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Most Exciting</p><strong>Starburst Flavored Fruit By The Foot</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>These taste exactly like Starbursts. Like, exactly like Starbursts. I was blown away. If you’re a Starburst fan, you have to go buy these right now! I’m not even that into Starbursts and I think these taste great. They’re fruity and super sweet. These would obviously be great in a lunchbox, but they feel special enough that I’d be thrilled to find them in an Easter basket or Christmas stocking. They’re the best fruit roll ups for the Halloween candy bowl, too.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best fruit roll ups" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RANKING-UPDATE_FRUIT-ROLLS_INSET-02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Classic</p><strong>Fruit by the Foot</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>Nothing hits quite like a variety pack, and Fruit by the Foot is no exception.&nbsp; We love all of the flavors: Berry Tie-Dye, Blue Raspberry Tie-Dye, and Strawberry Tie-Dye. None of these taste like a fruit you’d find in nature, but we don’t care. To be honest, nothing about this product feels natural. I have no clue why someone invented a very long piece of fruit leather. That being said, I’m glad they did! It tastes really delicious and is fun to eat in such a childlike way.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best fruit roll up" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RANKING-UPDATE_FRUIT-ROLLS_INSET-01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>Fruit Roll-Ups with Tongue Tattoos</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>The tongue tattoo Fruit Roll-Ups were the coolest possible thing the adult in your household could add to your childhood lunch. Luckily, our taste test showed that these are just as cool as I remember. Not only that, the tongue tattoos work even better than in my memories. It imprinted a bright blue, perfectly outlined rainbow on my tongue, and I was thrilled. And it’s not just the fun factor that we liked. The taste is great, too! The fruitiness is prominent and the texture was chewy without being sticky. This whole experience made me feel so nostalgic, and that’s why these Fruit Roll-Ups are the best fruit roll ups money can buy.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other Products We Tried:</strong> Annie’s Really Peely Fruit Tape, Fruit Roll Ups Peel n Build, Bear Fruit and Veggie Rolls, Veggie-Go’s Organic Fruit Punch Rolls</p><p class="has-light-purple-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>S</strong>hare your favorite<strong> fruit roll ups and fruit strips </strong>with us using #SporkedTasteTest for a chance to be featured on our social pages!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKyYmnqjsdKtZJ%2BqpZ7Bbr7OpaNmraCofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
