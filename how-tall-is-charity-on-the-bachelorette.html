But that’s not all! She has a successful career in Columbus, Georgia, as a child and family therapist who revealed that her name, Charity, inspires her to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“love and care for people and (she) has built her life on that purpose.</a>”</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true>Lawson has a master’s degree in clinical mental health counseling from Auburn University, and became America’s Sweetheart after charming fans on&nbsp;<a href=#>season 27</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=#>The Bachelor</a>&nbsp;because of her confidence and compassion.</p><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=171 data-injectable=false>Bachelor Zach Shallcross shed a few tears when he sent Charity Lawson home on his season.
