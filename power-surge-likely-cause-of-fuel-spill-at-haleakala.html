Anthony Mastalir speaks Monday afternoon at the summit of Haleakala during a press conference at the site where 700 gallons of diesel fuel spilled last week. The Maui News / MATTHEW THAYER photo</p><p>HALEAKALA — A power surge amid a lightning storm is the likely cause of a mechanical issue that allowed an estimated 700 gallons of diesel fuel to spill onto a concrete pad and into the surrounding soil at the summit of Haleakala last week, authorities say.</p><p>The surge apparently impacted a float that sits on the surface of the fuel and failed to stop a transfer pump or sound the alarm as the tank overflowed.</p><p><span class=quotations>“We have examined the fuel storage tank and the generator equipment, and we currently assess that the cause of this spill was a damaged float within the generator’s main fuel tank. Specifically the evidence suggests that a power surge was the likely cause of this damage,”</span> Brig. Gen. Anthony Mastalir, commander of the U.S. Space Forces Indo-Pacific, said during a news conference at the summit on Monday afternoon.</p><p>Surrounded by a team that included military officials and specialists in archaeology, water quality and engineering, Mastalir issued a public apology.</p><p><span class=quotations>“On behalf of the Department of the Air Force, I want to express my sincere apologies for what happened here one week ago today,”</span> Mastalir said. <span class=quotations>“Words cannot describe the tremendous remorse that I and the rest of the team here at the summit have experienced over this past week. We have a solemn responsibility to protect this sacred ground upon which we have the privilege to operate, and it is a privilege, not a right. You expect more from us, and last week we let you down, and for that I am truly sorry.”</span></p><img width=600 height=450 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2023/02/07061645/os-kakoo-222.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>Kako‘o Haleakala and the Friends of Haleakala National Park held a sign waving event at the Haleakala summit on Sunday. Kako‘o Haleakala photo</p><p>The spill site at the Maui Space Surveillance Complex comprises a teal-colored container with a diesel generator and a fuel tank on a concrete pad. On Monday afternoon, the site was surrounded by sheets of black tarp held down by wooden pallets and concrete blocks.</p><p>The generator serves as the backup source of power to keep operations going if commercial power supplied by Hawaiian Electric goes out, as in the case of the lightning storm that occurred last weekend, Mastalir explained. The fuel tank inside supports the generator.</p><p>On the evening of Jan. 29, a pump for the backup generator failed to shut off due to a mechanical issue. Mastalir explained that the damaged float, which was supposed to stop the pump, rests on the top of the fuel, much like the float in the back of a toilet.</p><p><span class=quotations>“When the fuel drops to a certain level, the float is designed to call for more fuel, and the transfer pump moves fuel from a storage tank into the generator’s main tank,”</span> Mastalir said. <span class=quotations>“As the fuel in that main tank rises, the float should then send a signal to the transfer pump to turn off. If for some reason that pump does not turn off and the float continues to rise, it is designed to then send an alarm so that we notify individuals that there is a potential overflow situation. This float failed in a way that none of those signals were sent.”</span></p><p>Thus, the transfer pump continued to send fuel from the storage tank into the generator’s main tank. Overnight, the fuel began to overflow and seep down onto the sides of the concrete pad, Mastalir said.</p><img width=600 height=343 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2023/02/07061606/mt-oil-spill-generator-2-6-23.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>An electrical surge is the suspected cause of the equipment failure that&nbsp;caused 700 gallons of diesel fuel to spill from this emergency generator last week. The Maui News / MATTHEW THAYER photo</p><p>All of this happened during a weekend of <span class=quotations>“pretty inhospitable”</span> weather at the summit, with severe rain, high winds and numerous lightning strikes.</p><p><span class=quotations>“As we go through this analysis and we look at the evidence, it all contributes to this conclusion that a power surge is likely what caused the damage to this float,”</span> Mastalir said.</p><p>Site maintenance personnel discovered the problem at 8 a.m. Jan. 30 and immediately deactivated the transfer pump.</p><p>Mastalir said they estimated the extent of the spill based on how much fuel they started with, the generator’s rate of consumption and the fuel levels at the time the leak was discovered. He said the estimate of 700 gallons is the <span class=quotations>“worst case scenario”</span> and assumes that the main generator tank was at the lowest possible point, though the spill could have amounted to less than that.</p><p>The initial plan will be to remediate 200 cubic yards around the generator, which would be to a depth of about 6 feet.</p><p><span class=quotations>“At that point we will take measurements to better understand what that level of contamination is,”</span> he said. <span class=quotations>“It’s impossible to know at this point exactly how deep the diesel fuel was saturated into the topography.”</span></p><p>Based on the analysis of those first 200 cubic yards, they’ll decide how to proceed.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Moving forward we are focused on thorough and complete remediation here at Haleakala,”</span> Mastalir said. <span class=quotations>“However, industry standard remediation processes and protocols are not sufficient for this sacred ground. We have to go above and beyond what would otherwise be deemed acceptable, and that is what we are going to do.”</span></p><p>The generator is still being used, but the transfer pump is being operated manually, he said.</p><p>On Sunday morning, about 40 people, including leaders from Kako’o Haleakala and the Friends of Haleakala National Park, gathered at the summit to wave signs and meet with military officials.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Details of the fuel leak and possible remediation plans were discussed,”</span> Kako’o Haleakala said. <span class=quotations>“Our organization urged the military to continue to engage with Kako’o Haleakala, to hire local engineers, consultants, and archaeologists to come up with a plan to clean up the contaminated soils, and also requested a cultural monitor be present at all times.”</span></p><p>Kako’o Haleakala said the group will continue to have discussions with the U.S. Air Force.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Our leaders made it clear that the trust is broken and will, without a doubt, continue to advocate for the removal of the telescopes from the mauna and against any lease renewal to the Maui Space Surveillance System,”</span> the organization said in statement Monday night.</p><p>When asked what he would say in response to calls for the state to cancel the Air Force’s lease at the summit when it expires in 2031, Mastalir said, <span class=quotations>“We are going to continue to work to rebuild the trust with all Hawaiians, with these Native Hawaiians and their organizations, so that we, given the privilege to operate here, will do so safely and respectfully.”</span></p><p>Mastalir said he told the group on Sunday that <span class=quotations>“we want you to be part of this process.”</span></p><p>Ki’ope Raymond, president of Kilakila ‘o Haleakala, said that the organization has disagreed in the past that the military should even be on the mountain, but while they are there, they have to increase their vigilance.</p><p><span class=quotations>“People have pointed to Red Hill and the other types of spills that have occurred recently, and for this to continue to happen, and to happen in a sacred space, is really difficult, it’s just so difficult to take,”</span> Raymond said Monday evening.</p><p>* Colleen Uechi can be reached at cuechi@mauinews.com.
