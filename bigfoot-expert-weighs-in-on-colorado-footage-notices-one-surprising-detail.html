There’s not enough detail to be able to judge it but it wouldn’t surprise me if somebody from [another Bigfoot] museum was out to build up publicity.”</p><p>Professed eyewitnesses Shannon and Stetson Parker claim to have observed the legendary lummox while enjoying a sightseeing tour on the narrow gauge rail line between Durango and Silverton, in the Centennial State’s far southwest.</p><p>“We were looking for elk in the mountains and my husband sees something moving and then can’t really explain it. So he’s like ‘Bigfoot!’” Shannon, a 44-year-old contractor from Cheyenne, Wyo. told The Post.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized">Shannon and Stetson Parker claimed to have captured the Bigfoot on camera while hiking in Colorado. <span class=credit>Shannon Parker /Facebook</span></figure><p>“It was at least six, seven feet or taller. It matched the sage in the mountains so much that he’s like camouflaged when crouching down… if you asked before our trip we would have said maybe [Bigfoot] could be real, but now we’re convinced.”</p><p>Shannon, who shared video of the odd one-to-two minute sighting<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> in a Facebook post</a>, also said that the train’s conductor told the couple of a similar, previous non-human sighting.</p><p>“He said that he went out snowshoeing in those mountains before and had seen footprints that were larger and of much bigger stride than snowshoes would have been,” Parker said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The couple made the sighting while touring the narrow gauge rail line between Durango and Silverton. <span class=credit>Shannon Parker /Facebook</span></figure><p>“He has seen unexplainable things as well.”</p><p>Some took the couple’s Bigfoot claims in stride.</p><p>One commented “I believe” on Shannon’s post, with another saying “love it!” Though, not everyone is as convinced that Chewbacca’s doppelgänger exists.</p><p>“And what were y’all drinking?” another commented.</p><p>Parker said some were skeptical that it could have been someone, for example a hunter, in natural camouflage, or a prank pulled by locals for the benefit of unsuspecting tourists.</p><p>“It didn’t look like a hunter because a hunter would have had a weapon like a bow since its bow season,” she added. “It didn’t seem to be carrying anything.”</p><p>According to Rugg, Bigfoot does exist and he claims to have spoken to “hundreds of witnesses” as well as laid eyes on one himself.</p><p>“They are out there,” he told The Post.</p><p>“I saw one when I was a child. It was a great big hairy man about two or three feet taller than my parents. And the one I saw had a plaid shirt just on its arm. I figured it took it off a clothesline, got it up to the armpit and it wouldn’t go further because it was too small for him, so he left it on his arm.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was quite a sight seeing a bigfoot just standing there with a shirt on one arm.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Bigfoot expert Michael Rugg told The Post that he couldn’t debunk the couple’s photo, but is suspicious about its legitimacy. <span class=credit>Michael Rugg</span></figure><p>Rugg said he “did not feel threatened” in the moment because he “had no preconception.”</p><p>“I had no reason to fear this as it didn’t have its teeth bared and wasn’t making scary noises or coming after me,” he explained.</p><p>“It was just standing there and probably curious how I’d react to it.”&nbsp;</p><p>Rugg also claims to have heard the Bigfoot “scream” on multiple occasions while out trying to locate one.</p><p>“One bigfoot was screaming and others responded then a pack of coyotes joined in…. we’ve had that happen a few times,” he said.</p><p>“The dogs here learn that if Bigfoot goes through your yard, you don’t bark and wake up people, because he doesn’t want people to know it’s there.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Rugg claims to have seen a bigfoot himself when he was a child. <span class=credit>Michael Rugg</span></figure><p>He said it’s unclear why the alleged beast tends to avoid detection but he has some theories.</p><p>“I think the Bigfoot observed (humans) years ago and watched us annihilate the buffalo as a sport and take land away from indigenous people…and they think these hairless creatures known as humans are dangerous,” Rugg said.</p><p>“But it’s a mystery…especially a scientific mystery.&nbsp;</p><p>“Some people think it’s an extraterrestrial because it has mind-speak.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Rugg said the creature in Parker’s video has a “strong possibility of being a guy in a suit.” <span class=credit>Shannon Parker /Facebook</span></figure><p>“Other people think they come from another dimension and bop in and out of ours from time to time.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m on the fence. I allow for all of them because maybe it’s not just one thing going on – and that’s why it’s so fascinating.“</p><p>It’s been a busy year for the hirsute heffalump — over the summer, an alleged Bigfoot sighting <a href=#>was supposedly caught on camera</a> in the woods of Mississippi.</p><p>Americans have been reporting sightings of the big galoot, with many reports coming from the forests of the Pacific Northwest, since the 1800s.</p><p>A description provided by Washington’s National Guard is consistent with the Parkers’ account.</p><p>“Those who claim to have seen Bigfoot have described everything from a large, upright ape to an actual hairy human, sometimes standing over eight feet tall and described as powerfully built.</p><p>The debate and research continue,” <a href=#>the armed forces branch wrote</a> in a post about the legend.</p><p>The University of Arizona adds that the folklore may come from an extinct giant ape, called Gigantopithecus, that existed in tandem with early humans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmanFfl7aoss6oq2adqKWys8CMsJyin5ioeqq6jKilZpufobyzrcOoZJ%2Bnn6muqLGMp6atoZOawG67zZ5krK2ipb%2Bqv8innmaclamuqriO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
