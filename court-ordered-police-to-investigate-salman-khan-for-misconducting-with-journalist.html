This comes a very long time after the recorder moved court looking for enlistment of a First Information Report (FIR) against the Bollywood star and his protectors for purportedly attacking him even after he supposedly looked for consent to click photographs and recordings of the entertainer who was riding a bike. As per the most recent report on DNA, Ashok Pandey, the journalist, apparently said that if the court didn’t step in, the cops wouldn’t have enrolled his grievance. “I was sure the court would not turn me down the manner in which the neighborhood Mumbai police had. DN Nagar police headquarters had overlooked me simply because my attacker was film star Salman Khan,” he said while expressing that the cops would not record an instance of robbery and criminal terrorizing. In a past report on PTI, the journalist, documented a ‘private complaint’ in the court of R R Khan, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Andheri, under IPC sections 323 (causing hurt), 392 (burglary), and 506 (criminal terrorizing). According to the complaint, the incident occurred in the extremely early times of April 24th when Salman Khan was riding a bike accompanied by two bodyguards. Pandey said he was riding in a vehicle, and in the wake of recognizing the on-screen character – known to be a bike aficionado – began recording a video subsequent to looking for the assent of Khan’s protectors. The on-screen character, in any case, got maddened, and his protectors supposedly went to the vehicle and began whipping Pandey, the application said. He additionally asserted that Khan also attacked him and grabbed away his cell phone and erased two video recordings. He guarantees that the police would not enlist his objection and requested that he get a court request for the examination. “Also, you can see that the court has discovered legitimacy for my situation,” Pandey said. The senior police inspector Parmeshwar Ganame checked the report and said that the team will investigate the issue and will present their report by one month from now. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsmpmke6S7zGiZoqejZLumw9Jomqitoql6sL7DnqmenF2lvK21wp5kraddnru3sdKtoKCZpJp6tK3LppinZZudrq95xaipZqWZqLCwusOumq2hnpx6uLXToWSjp6Wnu6K4yKyraA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
