Likewise, 40K’s miniatures are exclusively produced by Games Workshop, the manufacturer that first launched the franchise.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>Initially founded as a wooden board game manufacturer, the company soon started importing the U.S. role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons, then publishing its own wargames. Games Workshop has always been clear about its interest in progressive gaming, including video games, where its brands have found great success.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true>However, in 1979 the company founded Citadel Miniatures to produce models for its role-playing and tabletop games. That sub-brand has become synonymous with Games Workshop, although it has subsequently been folded into the overarching brand.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>The miniatures are necessary for gaming—tabletop battles wouldn’t be the same without them—but they have created a side hobby of their own. Players of Warhammer 40K must buy, build, and paint miniatures themselves. The two aspects work together, although some collectors particularly enjoy the peaceful distraction of painting and crafting exquisitely small works of art.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>Games Workshop magazine White Dwarf has long provided expanded mythology for the universe, supplemental game rules, and examples and tips for legions of fans to paint their miniatures.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Customizing Warhammer 40K miniatures</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Warhammer_40K_Miniatures.jpg><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>Over the decades, thousands of models have been produced. In Warhammer 40K’s dystopian future, where the stagnant Imperium of Man fights a vast and unwinnable war against aliens and the supernatural, the look of your army is almost as crucial as your gameplay.</p><p data-characters=692 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true>Most Warhammer 40K models are polystyrene and can be adorned and painted using Games Workshop’s brand glue, tools like brushes and hobby clippers, and acrylic Citadel Paints. The process for painting miniatures is complex, launching almost as many painting guides and several paint types in Games Workshops’ acrylic range. Every model has a set of rules governing its effectiveness on the tabletop field of battle, including durability, movement, and weapon range. Although there isn’t a recognized scale, they are approximately 1:60, with standard miniatures between 25 and 28mm. Vehicles naturally take up more table—models like the Baneblade super-heavy tank reach 24 cm in length.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Where can you buy Warhammer 40K miniatures?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Warhammer_40K_Space_Marines.jpg><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>Games Workshop exclusively handles the manufacture and distribution of all Warhammer 40K miniatures.
