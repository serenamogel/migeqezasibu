Borrowing heavily from its predecessor, the spinoff featured Cameron Bure's D.J. as a widow and mother in her old childhood home, with Saget, Stamos and most of the rest of the original cast making regular appearances. The formula reeled in both nostalgic fans and those of a new generation, with Fuller House picking up wins at the People's Choice Awards and Kids' Choice Awards over the course of its five-season run.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During her Full House years, Cameron Bure attended a charity hockey game in which co-star Dave Coulier was playing.
