Clark led all scorers with 30 points.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Clark Has History with Connecticut</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Iowa hasn’t lost a step in 2024, taking a 33-4 record into Friday’s showdown with Connecticut as a No. 1 tournament seed. The Hawkeyes have topped Holy Cross, West Virginia, Colorado, and LSU to reach the semifinals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">If being in the Final Four isn’t enough motivation for Clark, she and her opponent have history dating back to her recruitment period. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://247sports.com/article/caitlin-clark-still-bothered-by-uconn-no-offer-from-dream-school-ahead-of-ncaa-tournament-228997924/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clark has said UConn" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Clark has said UConn</a>, the 11-time national champion, was her dream school and even called it “the coolest place on Earth.” However, Huskies head coach Geno Auriemma never spoke with Clark or her family during the recruitment process, and she ultimately landed at Iowa.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Then there’s the fact that the Huskies eliminated Clark and the Hawkeyes from the tournament in 2021.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">So, naturally, a reporter asked Auriemma about facing Clark again. “Yeah, I hope Caitlin Clark had a personal agenda against LSU,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaw/2024/04/02/womens-final-four-dates-times-location-bracket-teams/73180057007/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Auriemma jokingly responded" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Auriemma jokingly responded</a>, referencing her Elite Eight win. “I know there’s nothing personal between me and her. I don’t need to be seeing her drop 50 on us next weekend. I love her. I think she’s the best player. Forget I ever said Paige [Bueckers] is the best player in the country.”</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Clark is “ready for the next chapter”</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Clark, a fourth-year senior, had an extra year of eligibility remaining at Iowa because of the COVID-19 pandemic but ultimately announced on February 29 she will join the pro ranks and declare for the WNBA, instead. “I knew in my heart here that what we’ve been able to do [at Iowa] is so special, and that it’s not over yet, but I think I’m ready for the next chapter in my life, too,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/basketball/wnba/fever/2024/03/01/caitlin-clark-explains-decision-why-leaving-iowa-for-wnba-draft-2024-indiana-fever-number-1-pick/72803164007/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she told IndyStar.com" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she told IndyStar.com</a>.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Read About Other Basketball Greats</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It is a near-guarantee that Clark will be the top draft pick and play for the Indiana Fever, and her decision is already creating buzz for next season. Pacers Sports and Entertainment, which operates the WNBA franchise, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://apnews.com/article/caitlin-clark-wnba-indiana-fever-tickets-843171ca69ffa6972f856ff80bf32628 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told the Associated Press" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told the Associated Press</a> that Clark has created “a lot of enthusiasm online and on social media” and, more importantly, a spike in ticket sales.
