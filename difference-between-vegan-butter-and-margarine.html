So let’s get to the bottom of some things: Is vegan butter the same thing as margarine? If not, what’s the difference? If Betty Botter bought a bit of vegan butter and put it in her bitter batter, would it make her bitter batter better? Or should she have used margarine instead? Just some questions I ask myself whenever I (vegan) butter a piece of bread. As for whether vegan butter and margarine differ, you butter believe we’re aboutta find out!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-ingredients-are-in-margarine-and-vegan-butter-respectively>What ingredients are in margarine and vegan butter, respectively?</h2><p>To understand how these two products differ, we have to know what’s in them. Like margarine, vegan butter is oil-based, and often contains some sort of plant-based oil emulsified with water, salt, and occasionally some plant-based solids. This oil can be canola, palm, avocado, cashew, coconut, or macadamia nut oil, and each option gives the spread a unique texture and cooking properties. As for margarine<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">, it’s made by</a> “mixing vegetable oils with water, salt, and emulsifiers until it’s got the consistency of butter.” Soooo…they sound pretty similar. Margarine used to be made with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">beef tallow</a>, but nowadays, it’s mainly made with vegetable oil.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-that-didn-t-clear-things-up-at-all-again-what-s-the-difference-between-vegan-butter-and-margarine>That didn’t clear things up at all. Again,&nbsp;what’s the difference between vegan butter and margarine?</h2><p>The main difference is that vegan butter is guaranteed plant-based, whereas margarine is allowed to have milk solids in it. According to the FDA, margarine must be a “food in plastic form or liquid emulsion, containing not less than 80 percent fat.” So it’s really what a company does with that remaining 20% (or more than 20% if you call it a <a href=# rel=noopener>“spread”</a> and not a “margarine” — food rules are so fun and pedantic). If it’s just vegetable oil, water, salt, and emulsifiers, the butter alternative in question may exist in that in-between space where a margarine just so happens to be vegan butter. If that 20% percent of other ingredients includes some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">milk products</a>, which is totally allowed for margarine, then it’s margarine, not vegan butter. Essentially, if margarine is vegan and 100% plant-based, then it is synonymous with vegan butter. If you’re vegan or don’t eat dairy for other reasons, always check the back of a margarine tub for a warning that the product “contains milk.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-so-is-vegan-butter-just-margarine-then>So is vegan butter just margarine then?</h2><p>The conclusion here: All vegan butter is margarine (unless it’s less than 80% fat; then it’s a vegan spread), but not all margarines are vegan since some contain milk. When it comes to categorizing plant-based margarines versus vegan butters, I say go with your gut. No matter what you decide to call it, there’s a high chance the plant-based butter (or margarine) you choose will make Betty Botter’s bitter batter better.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJyZm7OmvsSnmp5lkprBuLHEp2SvnZeWu26u1K2rnqpdlrulecyaqaCZop67pns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
