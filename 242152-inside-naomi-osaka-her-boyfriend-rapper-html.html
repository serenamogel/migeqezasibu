The tennis champ is currently dating rapper YBN Cordae, and they look pretty adorable together. Much to their fans' delight, they love posting <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CDUmkLxJCkz/>photographs</a> with each other on social media.</p><p class=Fg>Osaka might have been notoriously private about her love life in the past, but now she does not shy away from sharing cute snaps with her man who she has been calling her boyfriend since 2019.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>CORDAE WASN'T A TENNIS FAN</strong></p><p class=Fg>When Cordae <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a34011529/who-is-cordae-naomi-osaka-boyfriend/>first met</a> Osaka at a Los Angeles Clippers game, he did not even know who she was, let alone the extent of her success. He was someone who did not even watch tennis.</p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>The rapper has been by his queen's side during several US Open matches.</strong></h3><p class=Fg>The rapper went on and said that he was not a huge fan of the game. Just like any other average person who does not watch tennis, he only knew of Serena Williams. That was all.</p><p class=Fg>The couple was first linked together in April 2019, but it was also reported that they were not in a relationship at the time. Osaka did post a video with Cordae at the time and said she could not take him anywhere.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE OF EACH OTHER</strong></p><p class=Fg>Fast forward to December 2019, Osaka and Cordae attended a Clippers game but this time, as a couple!

How sweet!</p><p class=Fg>The couple looks pretty happy together. Both <a class="Xd a" href=#>Osaka</a> and Cordae love how they can learn so much from one another and talk about anything and everything.
