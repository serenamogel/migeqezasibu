I hated it. I really begged Russo. I was like… my daughter is in elementary school and I don’t want kids hearing about that and saying ‘Oh your mom, you know, had this other baby…’ I didn’t want to put her through that and I thought it was tacky and that was one fight I lost. I fought and fought and fought that angle… I begged Russo – I’m like “dude, don’t – just don’t” and he won and I lost that one.”</p><p>This interview includes Terri’s thoughts and memories of Brian Pillman, raising her daughter while being on the road, the Purchase of WCW’s implications and much more. You can find the hour-long chat in its entirety at Freak and Nitro TV or in the video player below:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwg5Nxam1tXamys77IZqmupp6aubR5wJ2koqyjYsGweceaq6Kml2LBqbGMnKanrKKkw6a%2B0qKYpWWWlrimecyiqpyZoqe2orPEZpinn5yaeqq6jLCunmWjnbywwNJmm6ivnmKubr7UpqarZaKatKK%2Bw6KloGWimrCmutNmoatloKSxpK3SrWSrnZ2Wv6y%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
