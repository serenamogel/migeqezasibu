It was 2008, and the Irish fighter had just quit his job as an apprentice plumber to follow his dreams of fighting in the UFC. He recalled to VIP the first time he and Devlin crossed paths. "I knew her a bit beforehand, but I think the first time I spoke to her properly was when I saw her in a nightclub," McGregor said.&nbsp;"I asked her to come over and we just started chatting."</p><p>For her part, Devlin confessed that she felt an instant attraction to McGregor as well. "He's very funny â€” he always keeps me entertained and makes me laugh," she said. "He was already training when I met him, so I really admired his dedication to that, too." They later added each other on&nbsp;the social networking website Bebo&nbsp;and the rest was history.</p><p>In the years since, <a href=#>Devlin and McGregor have built a solid foundation for a relationship,</a>&nbsp;and have stuck by each other's side as McGregor fought his way to the top and became one of the biggest names in the history of the UFC. Stressing how important Devlin is for him, McGregor said his success wouldn't at all be possible without the support of his longtime partner. "If it wasn't for her, I probably wouldn't be where I am today," <a href=#>he said</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampgZoV6fI6hprBlk6S7sL6MppqgqpWcvLN50Z6YpaSpYrqmwIyhoKxllp6ur6%2FEnmSdnZVisabCy6KlaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
